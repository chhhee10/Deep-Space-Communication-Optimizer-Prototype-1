Deep Space Communication Optimizer â€“ Prototype

A simulation tool for deep-space communication with smart packet prioritization and transmission visualization.

Overview

This prototype simulates the transmission of messages in a deep-space communication environment. Users can input custom messages, assign priority levels, and simulate message transmission under configurable conditions like distance and bandwidth. The system visualizes packets and the transmission process using graphs, helping understand how message priority and network constraints affect data delivery.

Features

Custom Message Input: Users can type any message to simulate transmission.

Priority Classification: Classify messages into three levels:

Emergency

High

Normal

Configurable Network Parameters: Set distance, bandwidth, and other transmission factors.

Packet Simulation: Converts messages into packets and simulates their transfer.

Graphical Visualization: Displays packet flow and transmission progress in real-time graphs.
